					LE BONHEUR pralines combine a classic French
					pralines recipe with the original taste of natural
					ingredients. Every piece is made with love,
					because we know that our emotions influence the
					quality of the product just as much as the
					ingredients do. We pick and toast the nuts, extract
					basil oil, choose seasonal berries and make creamy
					caramel from fresh cream, for we believe that
					sweets, just like life, need everything natural and
					whole-hearted.

				<p class="limited">
					We are in constant search for something new—we
					discover new places, find inspiration in nature, art,
					the smell of spices and flowers. Laurent Moreno
					puts this inspiration into seasonal pralines
					collections so that you can share the happiness
					with your loved ones.
